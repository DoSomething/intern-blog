## Q: What is your name? What was your intern position this summer at DoSomething.org? Where are you from? What college?

A: Hey, my name is Kerstin and I'm a Biz Dev Intern! I'm from Montvale, NJ and I graduated Montclair State University in the spring.

## Q: What was your favorite moment this summer at DoSomething.org?

A: Favorite moment of the summer, and one of my life, was the day I got impromptu hired instead of volunteering...but as an intern favorite moment was getting this ping, "fantastic you're doing great btw! don't think i tell you that enough. :)" from my manager! Knowing nothing about Biz Dev, working really hard, learning a lot, and getting recognized for doing things that are actually a part of the greater picture feels awesome!

## Q: Tell us about the most impactful project that you worked on this summer!

A: One of my professional goals was to get three sponsors in the pipeline...I have four and hoping to get a couple more before the end of the internship!

## Q: Who, other than your supervisor, did you learn something from and what was it?

A: I learned pitch practices from Nancy, how to pitch to a sponsor once you land a meeting from Bailee,  pop culture updates from Calvin, and city food spots from a slew of staff members!

## Q: What was your favorite or funniest New York City moment this summer?

A: Funniest? Well Nancy's birthday Fresh Prince rap was awesome.. but her reaction was even better.

## Q: Would you recommend an internship at DoSomething.org to your friends? If so, why?

A: FO SHO! Why? ... because DoSomething.org is everything it is said to be, but more. Much more smiles, personalities, and learning coming from one office in a 12 floor building in the city that never sleeps (except DS employees who are required to sleep and asked not stay past 5:30 pm), that is an hour and forty minute commute from my little hometown in suburbia.
