## Q: What is your name? What was your intern position this summer at DoSomething.org? Where are you from? What college?

A: My name is Dominick Recckio, I was a Business Development (Biz Dev) intern this summer. I hail from Port Byron New York, and study at Ithaca College, go bombers!

## Q: What was your favorite moment this summer at DoSomething.org?

A: My favorite moment is any one where I get to learn from our amazing peers here. From learning about data from Daniel and Jeff, to listening to what Aria has to say on any topic, I've learned and been inspired by a lot here. 

## Q: Tell us about the most impactful project that you worked on this summer!

A: Working on the Johnson and Johnson donate a photo partnership has been rewarding! It's great to be able to work on something that crosses teams here at DoSomething, and can have a real impact on our Birthday Mail campaign, helping to give kids in homeless shelters across the country happier birthdays.

## Q: Who, other than your supervisor, did you learn something from and what was it?

A: I love learning about leadership. And we have some AMAZING leaders here, learning from Nancy and Aria has been a spectacular experience, listening to the questions they ask during biz dev and campaign pitches gives true insight into the vision it takes to run the largest not for profit organization for young people and social change!

## Q: What was your favorite or funniest New York City moment this summer?

A: To be honest, each day getting off that elevator and seeing the DoSomething logo as I walk into the office gets me more stoked for the day than anything outside of work. 

## Q: Would you recommend an internship at DoSomething.org to your friends? If so, why?

A: Absolutely, if you're looking for a way to learn about impact, fun, cross-team business strategy, creativity, and/or all of the other amazing things I can't think of, yes. And the people you'll meet, priceless in and of itself.
