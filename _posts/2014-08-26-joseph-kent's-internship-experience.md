## Q: What is your name? What was your intern position this summer at DoSomething.org? Where are you from? What college?

A: My name is *technically* Joseph Kent, but you could just call me Joe. I'm a web dev here at DoSomething working on stuff like data dashboards and user api's. I'm native to NY but I'm stuck out in Staten Island unfortunately. Still in Highschool and I have no intentions of attending college. 

## Q: What was your favorite moment this summer at DoSomething.org?

A: Favorite moment? Presenting at innovation meeting was a great experience, and the scavenger hunt was a super fun challenge.. I dunno, I tend to avoid picking favorites.

## Q: Tell us about the most impactful project that you worked on this summer!

A: This summer I started work on a realtime data feed for DoSomething.org. A few weeks in Srikar joined me and focused on frontend development while I focused on backend. 

The 'activity feed' slide people love staring at should be attached to this response, but (hopefully) when you walk into the office for the first time you'll get to see it live! 

## Q: Who, other than your supervisor, did you learn something from and what was it?

A: I think I tend to learn something from almost everyone I work with, from the tech interns to the creative team. 

But if I had to pick something specific & relevant to tech... Daniel M (data intern) taught me about various algorithms such as paging, binary search, etc.

## Q: What was your favorite or funniest New York City moment this summer?

A: My "NYC experience" involves the subway and the ferry - you're probably better off reading the answers from people who go do things around the city.

## Q: Would you recommend an internship at DoSomething.org to your friends? If so, why?

A: Hell yes. There are no stereotypical coffee runs, you're going to be actively involved with projects working closely with staff and other interns. We also have scooters.
