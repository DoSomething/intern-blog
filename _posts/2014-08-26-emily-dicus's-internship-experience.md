## Q: What is your name? What was your intern position this summer at DoSomething.org? Where are you from? What college?

A: Hey, I'm Emily Dicus and I'm a Digital Content Intern. I'm from St. Louis, MO and I attend Drury University.

## Q: What was your favorite moment this summer at DoSomething.org?

A: I really liked playing on the undefeated kickball team.

## Q: Tell us about the most impactful project that you worked on this summer!

A: I got to write some of the social copy for our social media channels and for our external partners. I liked doing that because it's something my boss would normally do. I felt accomplished when it was all done and approved.

## Q: Who, other than your supervisor, did you learn something from and what was it?

A: I learned a lot from Ben and Chloe. I sat down with Ben and he gave me advice on writing as a career. Chloe and I had a meeting about marketing and partnerships with DoSomething that was helpful.

## Q: What was your favorite or funniest New York City moment this summer?

A: I didn't know anyone when I got here, which was a little intimidating. I loved getting to know the interns and staff and doing stuff with them outside of work.

## Q: Would you recommend an internship at DoSomething.org to your friends? If so, why?

A: If they are awesome and have the skills then yes because working for DoSomething.org was amazing.
