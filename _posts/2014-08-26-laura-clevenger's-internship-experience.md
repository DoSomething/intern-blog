## Q: What is your name? What was your intern position this summer at DoSomething.org? Where are you from? What college?

A: My name is Laura Clevenger and I'm a TMI Agency Intern! I was born in Rancho Murieta, California and I graduated from NYU.

## Q: What was your favorite moment this summer at DoSomething.org?

A: My favorite moment was definitely TMI's pitch to Yerdle-- a super cool new company. The whole team helped with the deck and strategy and everyone sit in and listened as Aria and Greg pitched them our three ideas-- and Yerdle loved them! It's been awesome to watch the whole process from the initial research to signing a contract. 

## Q: Tell us about the most impactful project that you worked on this summer!

A: My favorite project was definitely creating a strategy doc to make TMI's Google Hangouts more efficient. We use Hangouts to interact with our Youth Advisory Councils. The project was a combination of creative thinking and data analysis -- both things I love! 

## Q: Who, other than your supervisor, did you learn something from and what was it?

A: Dee! He is my life Yoda. 

## Q: What was your favorite or funniest New York City moment this summer?

A: Falling on my bike in the pouring rain, getting a concussion, and having to ride the rest of the way home... oh, wait.

## Q: Would you recommend an internship at DoSomething.org to your friends? If so, why?

A: Duh! I have learned more here in 6 months than any other job or internship combined.
