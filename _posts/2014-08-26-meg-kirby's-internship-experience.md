## Q: What is your name? What was your intern position this summer at DoSomething.org? Where are you from? What college?

A: My name is Meg Kirby and I am the content intern. I am from Saco, Maine, and I attend Fairfield University.

## Q: What was your favorite moment this summer at DoSomething.org?

A: The Spring Dinner was a blast. It was a week in so the interns didn't really know each other that well so it was a great way to get to know each other. We got to meet some really cool people like Van Jones from CNN and Monique Coleman from High School Musical (the 13 year-old in me was freaking out).

## Q: Tell us about the most impactful project that you worked on this summer!

A: I've been working on our 11 Facts pages. The 11 Facts pages are over 100 fact sheets on different subjects ranging from bullying and self esteem to hurricanes and giraffes (seriously!). The fact pages actually bring in roughly 53% of total site traffic. I've been working to individualize each fact page and pair it with a live campaign.

## Q: Who, other than your supervisor, did you learn something from and what was it?

A: I learned a lot from Jeff and Julie about SEO strategy and how important it is to an organization like DoSomething.

## Q: What was your favorite or funniest New York City moment this summer?

A: My favorite NYC memory from this summer was when a small group of us went to the Today Show when Nat Wolff was on for Give-A-Spit while promoting The Fault in Our Stars. It was pouring and we weren't sure of when Nat was going to be on and misjudged it by hours. Despite the whole mess, we had such a great time and it was one of the most memorable things I did all summer!

## Q: Would you recommend an internship at DoSomething.org to your friends? If so, why?

A: I would totally recommend an internship at DoSomething.org to anybody. Not only do you have the opportunity to work with some amazing people but you work on projects that have actual impact and feel like you're actually getting real world experience.
