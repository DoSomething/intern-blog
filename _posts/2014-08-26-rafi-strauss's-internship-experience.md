## Q: What is your name? What was your intern position this summer at DoSomething.org? Where are you from? What college?

A: I'm Rafi Strauss. I'm a senior at Yeshiva College, and am a Developer Intern at Do Something this summer.

## Q: What was your favorite moment this summer at DoSomething.org?

A: The scavenger hunt was pretty fun, but really every day is super awesome. Working with great people on interesting projects just makes the days fly by.

## Q: Tell us about the most impactful project that you worked on this summer!

A: I worked on a system to make creating and modifying the DoSomething SMS games much easier. I picked up and utilized Angular.js to keep everything in sync.

## Q: Who, other than your supervisor, did you learn something from and what was it?

A: One of the best parts about DoSomething is the awesome people who work here -  you can learn a ton from everybody. To pick one, I learned the importance of a second set of eyes from Srikar and Daniel.

## Q: What was your favorite or funniest New York City moment this summer?

A: Probably chilling at a Beethoven concert earlier this summer - highly recommended (if you like that sort of thing).

## Q: Would you recommend an internship at DoSomething.org to your friends? If so, why?

A: Totally - things are just done RIGHT at DoSomething. After seeing the way the office works, how they actually care about their employees, you begin to wonder how it could be done any other way.
