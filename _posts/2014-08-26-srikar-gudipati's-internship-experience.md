## Q: What is your name? What was your intern position this summer at DoSomething.org? Where are you from? What college?

A: My name is Srikar Gudipati and I was the Web Development Intern this summer at DoSomething.org! I'm from New Jersey and I will be going to 12th grade in high school this September.

## Q: What was your favorite moment this summer at DoSomething.org?

A: As Diego said, this is a really tough question. The overall experience at DoSomething.org was awesome for me as the office's environment was very fun and hardworking at the same time!

## Q: Tell us about the most impactful project that you worked on this summer!

A: Joe and I worked on the Lobby Dashboard, which, as the name implies, is a dashboard displayed in the lobby that portrays the latest data about DoSomething's members!

## Q: Who, other than your supervisor, did you learn something from and what was it?

A: I've learned a ton of resume and interview tips from Marah in her workshop! It was really helpful as I am still in high school and therefore, don't have a lot of career development skills under my belt yet.

## Q: What was your favorite or funniest New York City moment this summer?

A: My favorite New York City moment this summer was searching the city area around my office with my fellow interns and finding new restaurants, shops, and attractions!

## Q: Would you recommend an internship at DoSomething.org to your friends? If so, why?

A: Of course! Where else can an intern be an integral part of the staff and have fun at the same time?
