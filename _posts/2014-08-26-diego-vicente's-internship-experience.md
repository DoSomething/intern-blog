## Q: What is your name? What was your intern position this summer at DoSomething.org? Where are you from? What college?

A: My name is Diego Vicente and I worked as the Quality Assurance (QA) intern this summer at dosomething. I'm from the Bronx and I'm studying at the New York Institute of Technology pursuing a degree in computer science. 

## Q: What was your favorite moment this summer at DoSomething.org?

A: This is a tough question to be honest. This summer has been perhaps one of the better summers I've had to date and there's been a lot of memorable moments throughout the summer, but I'd have to say that the intern outings have been my favorite part of the summer. 

## Q: Tell us about the most impactful project that you worked on this summer!

A: Email Digest for sure! Being able to help with the testing process and ensuring that the features of the new email digest system for our users was something that was rather rewarding for me to have taken part of. 

## Q: Who, other than your supervisor, did you learn something from and what was it?

A: I've learned from our CTO Matt with setting up local machines using the Terminal on a mac os x based platform (never used the terminal prior to that). 

## Q: What was your favorite or funniest New York City moment this summer?

A: Awkward photoshoots are awkward... 

## Q: Would you recommend an internship at DoSomething.org to your friends? If so, why?

A: Without any hesitation I would recommend doing a internship at dosomething to my friends. Working at dosomething is a very rewarding place to work for various reasons, whether it's because of the kickass staff, the open office space, and just the general vibe from the office. We work hard. but we play just as hard.
