## Q: What is your name? What was your intern position this summer at DoSomething.org? Where are you from? What college?

A: My name is Samvitha Ram and I'm an Intern for the TMI Agency. My hometown is Mumbai, India and I currently live in Caversham, U.K. I attend Princeton University.

## Q: What was your favorite moment this summer at DoSomething.org?

A: I loved the member party during DoSomething's June event. It was amazing to be filled in a room with young people who were excited by everything DoSomething did, and really cared about changing things in their respective communities. 

My favorite moment: When I realized that every girl between 13-18 knew exactly who Bryce was...and actively followed him on our Snapchat!

## Q: Tell us about the most impactful project that you worked on this summer!

A: I think handling the Youth Advisory Council for the CollegeBoard was probably my most impactful project. I worked on building the surveys, analyzing the responses, creating data briefs, talking with the members of the YAC through our Google Hangouts, and writing summaries for the CollegeBoard to hear what young people had to say about their various programs.

## Q: Who, other than your supervisor, did you learn something from and what was it?

A: I think that working in a small team like TMI was great, because I frequently had different supervisors for different projects, even know Lisa was my direct "manager".

From (the original) Greg, I learned that it was okay to have different ideas than others did during creative brainstorming sessions. From Lizzy, I learned how to be funny as well as professional in my writing (yay TMI Blog Posts!). From Lisa, I learned how to prioritize different projects - and that it's awful to start a sentence with "however"!

## Q: What was your favorite or funniest New York City moment this summer?

A: Favorite moment: watching the 4th of July fireworks on the Brooklyn Bridge with a group of close friends

Funniest moment: when I got locked out of my apartment the same day that I made a big speech to my best friend about how I'm the only one that always has my keys.

## Q: Would you recommend an internship at DoSomething.org to your friends? If so, why?

A: I absolutely would! It's an amazing place to learn, the office culture is so nurturing and accepting, and interns get to handle real responsibilities instead of being given "side projects", like they would at many other places.
