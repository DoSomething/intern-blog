## Q: What is your name? What was your intern position this summer at DoSomething.org? Where are you from? What college?

A: My name is Steven Hartwig, and I am the "Tech Wizard" working for Gleb. I am originally from Florida, but go to school at Pace University in the financial district.

## Q: What was your favorite moment this summer at DoSomething.org?

A: My favorite moment this summer at DoSomething is definitely the spring event, where I got to interact with our members, dance with some of the most important people to the organization, and see De La Soul!

## Q: Tell us about the most impactful project that you worked on this summer!

A: The most impactful project I worked on was probably the installation of the Mac Server, because it will be used to manage every Mac in the office, (which just recently became the majority over PC's!)

## Q: Who, other than your supervisor, did you learn something from and what was it?

A: I learned a lot about dancing at our pride party from every intern. I had a little game where I would learn a different dance move from each individual person, and I had a whole lot of fun!

## Q: What was your favorite or funniest New York City moment this summer?

A: My favorite moment in New York City so far was actually because of DoSomething. One of the scavenger hunt activities had us dance a flash mob in public, and I made a total fool of myself but it was hilarious!

## Q: Would you recommend an internship at DoSomething.org to your friends? If so, why?

A: I DEFINITELY would recommend an Internship at DS to my friends, it is the most fun I have ever had, and I got paid to do it!
