## Q: What is your name? What was your intern position this summer at DoSomething.org? Where are you from? What college?

A: Hi, my name is Emily Schnee and I'm a Sex, Relationships, & Violence Campaigns Intern! I'm from Long Island, NY and I attend UMass Amherst.

## Q: What was your favorite moment this summer at DoSomething.org?

A: Getting my first campaign approved by our CEO, Nancy

## Q: Tell us about the most impactful project that you worked on this summer!

A: A gun within the home is 22 times more likely to be involved in accidental shootings and suicide attempts rather than for self defense. While 72% of parents cap electrical outlets and hide poisonous substances, only  45 percent of parents lock away their guns. This may be because 72% of parents believe that their child would not touch their gun without permission. I created a campaign called Lock It up to get out members to ask parents to lock up weapons that are kept within the house. 

## Q: Who, other than your supervisor, did you learn something from and what was it?

A: I have learned much about pitching, constructive criticism, using time effectively, and anticipating critiques from every member of the campaigns team. Through our meetings, I got very helpful feedback to improve on all aspects of my internship.

## Q: What was your favorite or funniest New York City moment this summer?

A: This question has to be dedicated to my fellow campaigns interns. Collaborating with them to create a Campaigns guide has brought some hilarious moments that has brought us even closer.

## Q: Would you recommend an internship at DoSomething.org to your friends? If so, why?

A: Absolutely! I love everything about my internship here at DoSomething.org. Not only was everyone extremely welcoming, they treated the interns as staff. A typical stereotype of an intern would be that they go get coffee and do busy work- however that was not the case interning at here. I was given freedom and responsibility to be create my own campaigns and not only help others with their work. I am leaving feeling accomplished that my work will go somewhere.
